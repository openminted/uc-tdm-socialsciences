        <region class="unknown" id="11" page="1" column="1">Abstract Ambient Assisted Living aims at enhancing the quality of life of older and disabled people at home thanks to Smart Homes. In particular, regarding elderly living alone at home, the detection of distress situation after a fall is very important to reassure this kind of population. However, many studies do not include tests in real settings, because data collection in this domain is very expensive and challenging and because of the few available data sets. The C corpus is a dataset recorded in realistic conditions in D , a fully equipped Smart Home with microphones and home automation sensors, in which participants performed scenarios including real falls on a carpet and calls for help. These scenarios were elaborated thanks to a field study involving elderly persons. Experiments related in a first part to distress detection in real-time using audio and speech analysis and in a second part to fall detection using video analysis are presented. Results show the difficulty of the task. The database can be used as standardized database by researchers to evaluate and compare their systems for elderly person’s assistance. Keywords: audio and video data set, multimodal corpus, natural language and multimodal interaction, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), distress situation.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="189" page="4" column="1"><s id="156" sid="98">Feedback from the participants were analyzed and allowed some conclusions (Body-Bekkadja et al., 2015).</s><s id="157" sid="99"> A high- lighted domestic accident, outlined (for oneself and for others) by C IRDO , leads the elderly individual to relate to the falls in other ways.</s><s id="158" sid="100"> They suddenly attempt to further regu- late and control it, sometimes by risking a profound change in behavior that may not be detected by C IRDO .</s><s id="159" sid="101"> More specifically, in our various studies (simulated C IRDO use), it was observed that: The elderly developed two oppos- ing conducts in the management of their fall monitored via C IRDO .</s><s id="160" sid="102"> Some of them chose to boost their falling movement or overplay screams to make sure the device will recognize the danger.</s><s id="161" sid="103"> They were also the same elderly that, as we mentioned in Study 2, used tangible remote monitoring systems (inset).</s><s id="162" sid="104"> They doubted the ability of the new am- bient system to detect their accident, and thus they risk a more serious injury.</s><s id="163" sid="105"> Others, however, in order to hide these incidents from the entourage, try to control the fall: They do not scream, and try to recover at all costs, even though it could exacerbate the deleterious effects of the fall.</s><s id="164" sid="106"> In both cases, we see that the falling movement choreography (falling is unintentional by nature) will be intentionally modified by the subjects, whether to be seen to fall, and, hence, be better recognized, or otherwise to be hidden from the technology and its supervision.</s><s id="165" sid="107"> Thus, the presence of technological artifacts changes the dynamic of the fall, because this behaviour will be addressed, directed toward a target (technology object), and also to other involved individuals.</s><s id="166" sid="108"> As mentioned by Clot (Clot, 1999), the movements of the falls are not only directed by the conduct of the sub- ject; they are also directed through the use of the technical object, and toward others (the representation they have of the system and the possible recipients of the alert).</s><s id="167" sid="109"> The fall choreography is influenced by what the individual wants to show to, or hide from, the device.</s><s id="168" sid="110"> Therefore, the risk of non-detecting these movements is possible, because they sometimes tend to veer too far from programmed scripts.</s><s id="169" sid="111"> Another more symbolical consequence involves the status and the legitimacy that C IRDO will give the fall.</s><s id="170" sid="112"> While, in the past, the word of the victim, or of a third party, used to be enough to prove the occurrence of a fall, these days, surveillance technologies are used to validate/approve the occurrence of an incident.</s><s id="171" sid="113"> We could even add that, they also assess whether this fall is acceptable, and conform to pre-defined scripts.</s><s id="172" sid="114"> In other words, the non-detection (non- recognition) of a fall by C IRDO may mean that: (1) The individual has poorly conducted the choreography of the falling; or (2) the movement cannot be categorized as a risk movement.</s><s id="173" sid="115"> This can therefore lead to a denial of risk and recognition of the elderly individual’s status of "victim", thereby throwing suspicion on their statements.</s><s id="174" sid="116"> As a result, C IRDO may operate a transfer of the risk recognition: It is the technology that gives official status to a fall in a domestic incident.</s><s id="175" sid="117"> It gives credibility and legitimacy to it.</s><s id="176" sid="118"> Thus, technological reliability wins against the word of the elderly; and then the latter can be discredited, for ex-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> ample, if the user talks about incidents not recognized by technology: “If the system is not triggered, then the fall did not occur."</s><s id="178" sid="119"> In both cases, setting C IRDO service in the domestic social system can either redefine the falls choreography, or redefine their status.</s><s id="179" sid="120"> All these reasons may be caused by malfunction or rejection.</s><s id="180" sid="121"> Several recommendations can be addressed to the design- ers.</s><s id="181" sid="122"> In addition to reassuring, involving, and properly training to use the new system (Hwang and Thorn, 1999)(Ku- jala, 2003), by including demonstrations and updates in real situations adapted to their habits and lifestyle practices (to demonstrate the system works efficiently in detecting falls, and avoiding any worsening of movements), design- ers should create programs and falls-detection algorithms more flexible, to cover a larger spectrum of falls choreography, and not rely solely on fixed scripts in risk behavior.</s><s id="182" sid="123"> In the same way, effective articulation between Audio and Video detections should be ensured to allow better falls- recognition and validation.</s><s id="183" sid="124"> As part of a participatory design through use (He and King, 2008), it would be interesting to adjust from feed- backs in the field, the location of the sensors and the level of falls scripts detection, by taking into account conduct- adjustments and daily risk evolutions from the moment the technological artifact is introduced.</s><s id="184" sid="125"> This requires a situated analysis of the actual device’s uses, in order to re-design it from its usage (Norman and Draper, 1986).</s><s id="185" sid="126"> This reinforced monitoring system will ask the elderly to make an oral (con- firmation) emergency call to an outside third party.</s><s id="186" sid="127"> This alert is then triggered only in case of a positive response, or a lack of response from the individual, enabling them to properly control the system (at to avoid false alarms).</s><s id="187" sid="128"> Finally, this new device for monitoring the activity will be meaningful only if it serves and supports its users’ quality of life.</s><s id="188" sid="129"> Therefore, one must be careful to involve and assist the various participants during all phases of C IRDO design, in an inclusive approach (as in the Living lab approach of (Pino et al., 2015), especially to anticipate reconfigurations at work in the social framework, as we shall now see.</s></region>
