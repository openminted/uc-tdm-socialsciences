###GROBID
For running the GROBID example, you have to build GROBID first on your local machine (Linux or Mac OS only!). Follow the instructions here: http://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install-Grobid/

After building, you may have to replace the ```grobid-core-0.4.1-SNAPSHOT.jar``` in the lib folder with the one in your own build. Then point the properties in the ```application.properties``` file to the base dir of your GROBID installation.
